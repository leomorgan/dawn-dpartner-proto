## Executive Summary

This roadmap prioritizes the module improvements needed to achieve the project goal: **"AI can generate design-grade outputs indistinguishable from human designers"**.

## Critical Success Factors from PROJECT_GOAL.MD

1. **"Generate a new layout"** - Currently BLOCKED by template limitations
2. **"Design-grade outputs"** - Currently CONSTRAINED by hardcoded patterns
3. **"Indistinguishable from human designers"** - Currently LIMITED by predictable patterns
4. **"Professional outputs"** - Currently COMPROMISED by fake metrics and templates
